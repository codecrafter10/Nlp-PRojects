🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Projects
This repository contains a collection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects that demonstrate practical applications of machine learning, deep learning, and linguistic analysis techniques on textual data. Each project is designed to address a real-world problem using advanced NLP methods.

📌 Projects Included
Sentiment Analysis
Classifies the sentiment of user-generated content such as tweets or reviews into positive, negative, or neutral categories.

Spam Detection
Detects spam messages in emails or SMS using classical ML algorithms and NLP preprocessing techniques.

Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Identifies and categorizes named entities (like names, dates, locations) from text using pre-trained models or custom architectures.

Text Summarization
Generates concise and meaningful summaries from large bodies of text using extractive or abstractive methods.

Text Classification
Categorizes documents into predefined classes, such as topic classification for news articles.

Chatbot with Intent Recognition
A rule-based or ML-powered chatbot capable of understanding user intent and generating contextual responses.

Language Translation
Translates text between different languages using transformer-based models like MarianMT or T5.

Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech (Hybrid)
Converts speech to text and vice versa using NLP techniques combined with speech processing.

🧰 Tech Stack
Languages: Python

Libraries & Frameworks:

NLTK, SpaCy, TextBlob, Gensim

Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Transformers (HuggingFace)
